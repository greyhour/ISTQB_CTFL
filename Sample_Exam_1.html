        <h4>Which of the following statements is a valid objective for testing?</h4>
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>The test should start as late as possible so that development had enough time to create a good product</li>

                    <li>Is not correct. Contradiction to principle 3: "Early testing saves time and money"</li>
                    <li>Is correct. This is one objective of testing</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. Principle #2 states that exhaustive testing is impossible, so one can never prove that all defects were identified</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. To make an assessment whether a defect will cause a failure or not, one must detect the defect first. Saying that no remaining defect will cause a failure implicitly means that all defects were found. This again contradicts principle #2</li>

            <li>Testing identifies the source of defects; debugging analyzes the defects and proposes prevention activities</li>
            <li>Dynamic testing shows failures caused by defects; debugging eliminates the defects, which are the source of failures</li>
            <li>Testing removes faults; but debugging removes defects that cause the faults</li>

                <ol type='a'>
                    <li>Is not correct. Testing does not identify the source of defects, debugging identifies the source of defects</li>
                    <li>Is correct. Dynamic testing can show failures that are caused by defects in the software. Debugging eliminates the defects, which are the source of failures</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. Testing does not remove faults, but debugging removes faults, which is synonymous with defects, that may cause the failures</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. Dynamic testing does not directly prevent the causes of failures (defects) but detects the presence of defects</li>

                    <li>Is correct. A crash is clearly noticeable by the user</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. This is a defect, not a failure since there is something wrong in the code. It may not result in a visible or noticeable failure, for example, if the changes in the source code file are only in comments</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. The use of wrong input variables may not result in a visible or noticeable failure, for example, if nobody uses this particular algorithm; or if the wrong input variable has a similar value to the correct input variable; or if the FALSE result of the algorithm is not used</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. This type of fault will not necessarily lead to a failure; for example, if no one uses this special algorithm</li>

        <h2>Question #5 (1 Point)</h2>
        <h4>Mr. Test has been testing software applications on mobile devices for a period of 5 years. He has a wealth of experience in testing mobile applications and achieves better results in a shorter time than others. Over several months, Mr. Test did not modify the existing automated test cases and did not create any new test cases. This leads to fewer and fewer defects being found by executing the tests. What principle of testing did Mr. Test not observe?</h4>
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>Testing depends on the environment</li>
            <li>Exhaustive testing is not possible</li>
            <li>Repeating the same tests will not find new defects</li>
            <li>Defects cluster together</li>

            <h5>Answer: c</h5>
            <p>
                <ol type='a'>
                    <li>Is not correct. Testing is context dependent, regardless of it being manual or automated (principle #6), but does not result in detecting a decreasing number of faults as described above</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. Exhaustive testing is impossible, regardless of the amount of effort put into testing (principle #2)</li>
                    <li>Is correct. Principle #5 says "If the same tests are repeated over and over again, eventually these tests no longer find any new defects. To detect new defects, existing tests and test data may need changing, and new tests may need to be written." Automated regression testing of the same test cases will not bring new findings</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. "Defects cluster together" (principle #4). A small number of modules usually contain most of the defects, but this does not mean that fewer and fewer defects will be found</li>
                </ol>

        <h2>Question #6 (1 Point)</h2>
        <h4>In what way can testing be part of Quality Assurance?</h4>
        <ol type='a'>
            <li>It ensures that requirements are detailed enough</li>
            <li>Testing reduces the risk of poor software quality</li>
            <li>It ensures that standards in the organization are followed</li>
            <li>It measures the quality of software in terms of the number of executed test cases</li>

                <ol type='a'>
                    <li>Is not correct. Static testing (reviews) contributes, but could not ensure that requirements are detailed enough</li>
                    <li>Is correct. Testing contributes to the achievement of quality in a variety of ways, e.g., such as reducing the risk of inadequate software quality</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. This is quality assurance but not testing</li>
                    <li>Is not correct. The quality cannot be measured by counting the number of executed test cases without knowing the outcome</li>

        <h2>Question #38 (1 Point)</h2>
        <h4>You are testing a new version of software for a coffee machine. The machine can prepare different types of coffee based on four categories. i.e., coffee size, sugar, milk, and syrup. The criteria are as follows:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Coffee size (small, medium, large)</li>
          <li>Sugar (none, 1 unit, 2 units, 3 units, 4 units)</li>
          <li>Milk (yes or no)</li>
          <li>Coffee flavor syrup (no syrup, caramel, hazelnut, vanilla)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now you are writing a defect report with the following information:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Title: Low coffee temperature.</li>
          <li>Short summary: When you select coffee with milk, the time for preparing coffee is too long and the temperature of the beverage is too low (less than 40 °C).</li>
          <li>Expected result: The temperature of coffee should be standard (about 75 °C).</li>
          <li>Degree of risk: Medium</li>
          <li>Priority: Normal</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What valuable information was omitted in the above defect report?</h4>
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>The actual test results</li>
          <li>Identification of the tested software version</li>
          <li>Status of the defect</li>
          <li>Ideas for improving the test case</li>
        </ol>

              <li>Is not correct. The test result is given in the short summary</li>
              <li>Is correct. When testing different versions of software, identifying information is necessary</li>
              <li>Is not correct. You are just writing the defect report; hence, the status is automatically open</li>
              <li>Is not correct. This information is useful for the tester but does not need to be included in the defect report</li>

        <h2>Question #39 (1 Point)</h2>
        <h4>Which one of the following is MOST likely to be a benefit of test execution tools?</h4>
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>It is easy to create regression tests</li>
          <li>It is easy to maintain version control of test assets</li>
          <li>It is easy to design tests for security testing</li>
          <li>It is easy to run regression tests</li>
        </ol>
        Select ONE option.

        <div class="panel">
          <h5>Answer: d</h5>
          <p>
            <ol type='a'>
              <li>Is not correct. The benefits are not when creating regression tests, more in executing them</li>
              <li>Is not correct. This is done by configuration management tools</li>
              <li>Is not correct. This needs specialized tools</li>
              <li>Is correct. Reduction in repetitive manual work (e.g., running regression tests, environment set up/tear down tasks, re-entering the same test data, and checking against coding standards), thus saving time</li>

          <li>Requirement management tools</li>
          <li>Configuration management tools</li>
          <li>Static analysis tools</li>
